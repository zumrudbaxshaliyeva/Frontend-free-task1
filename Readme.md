File Structure

HTML File

The main HTML file is structured as follows:

The head section includes:

meta tags for character encoding and responsive design.

A title tag for the webpage.

Inline style tags for basic CSS styling.

The body section contains:

A main heading (h1) titled ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

Two images displayed using img tags.

A descriptive paragraph within an h1 tag about AI.

Assets

The images used in the project are located in the following paths:

./assests/image/FOTO AI.jpg
./assests/image/FOTO2 AI.jpg

Features

Responsive Design: The meta viewport tag ensures compatibility with different screen sizes.

Styling: Images are styled using inline CSS to maintain consistent width and height.

How to Run

Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

Ensure the assests/image directory contains the images:

FOTO AI.jpg

FOTO2 AI.jpg

Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the webpage.

Notes

Ensure that the image paths are correct. If the images do not load, verify the folder and file names for typos.

You can further enhance the webpage by:

Adding external CSS for more detailed styling.

Using semantic HTML tags to improve accessibility.

Suggestions for Improvement

Replace the second style block in the head section with one consolidated block to avoid redundancy.

Use proper semantic tags (e.g., replace the descriptive h1 with a p or div tag).

Consider using alt text that provides more descriptive information for the images.
