            <h3>ABOUT MOON</h3>
            <p>
              The Moon is one of the most recognisable objects in the solar
              system. This proximity to Earth has given it immeasurable cultural
              significance and means it plays a key role in Earth's tides.

            <h3>SİZE AND DİSTANCE</h3>
            <p>
              With a radius of about 1,080 miles (1,740 kilometers), the Moon is
              less than a third of the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of
              a nickel, the Moon would be about as big as a coffee bean. The
              Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away.
              That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth and
              the Moon. The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth, getting about
              an inch farther away each year.
